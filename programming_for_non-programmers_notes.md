Used to be a Full Stack Engineer-both front and back end designer. Now mainly does front end, since it does a lot of heavy lifting now.

Goals: 

Day 1: Intro

* deeper understanding of HTML
* vocabulary 
* the basics of code

Day 2: Front-End

* javascript
* CSS

Day 3: Back-End

* ruby/rails
* basic blog
* web application

Stages of web development:

* design
* UX
* info architecture


### Section 1: How the Web Works

* Series of tubes-Ted Stevens
* **http://** = stands for (hyper text transfer protocol) use in our URL browsers
* **Host** (www is a mask for an address ie. www.nytimes.com) corresponds to a computer w/ an IP address (server)
* really get back to server is really 3 docs: HTML(hyper text markup language), CSS, Javascript

#### Rendering in the Browser

* each browser has its own rendering engine to interperet and display the markup
* IE, firefox, sarafi, opera, chrome
* [latest browser stats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers)

#### Two Ways of Responding

1. Hardcoded-static doc
2. Dynamic-html>server>program that generates HTML on the server


### Section 2: Front-End vs. Back-End
comparison: think of a resaturant. Front end what the consumers see. Backend end the kitchen staff, coookware, etc

##### Front-End languages

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript


##### Back-End languages

* ruby (language of the day)
* python
* php
* javascript

##### Back-End frameworks

* ruby on rails (for ruby)
* django (for python)
* node + express (for javascript)

##### New Open Source Javascript Front-End Frameworks

* Amber.js
* Angular.js (this is one instructor uses)
* Meteor.js (very new)
* D3js [creator Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/)
* React.js



### Section 3: What is Programming:

* the preparation of an expected outcome to follow a series of planned, or controlled events
* series of solutions 
> "Everyone should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think." *-Steve Jobs*

**Excercise:** Write step-by-step instructions for how to bake a cake. Think in terms of variables, classifying ingredients, loops, and functions.

##### Why do many programming languages? 

First language is like latin...you can learn other langages...some things are implicit to certain lanagues.  
i.e. German words like zeigtgeist, shadenfraude are not translatable in one word in other langugages.

##### Compiled vs. Interpreted languages 
* ruby is interpreted
* java (not javascript) is compiled i.e. operating at the machine code level (0 and 1s)


####What do programs actually do?
They automate things to make our lives easier.

* mark things up (HTML/CSS)
* keeping track of things (variables)
* making decisions (if>then)
* repeating things (loops)
* displaying things
* logs things (log files)
* storing things (databases)

Coding idiom: Keep it dry (means don't repeat yourself)

#### What can I build?

* websites (static)
* web applications (processes/servers data)
* native apps
* other things

### Section 4: Web Developemnt
