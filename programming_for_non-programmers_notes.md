Goals: 

Day 1: Intro

* deeper understanding of HTML
* vocabulary 
* the basics of code

Day 2: Front-End

* javascript
* CSS

Day 3: Back-End

* ruby/rails
* basic blog
* web application

Stages of web development:

* design
* UX
* info architecture


### Section 1: How the Web Works

* Series of tubes-Ted Stevens
* **http://** = stands for (hyper text transfer protocol) use in our URL browsers
* **Host** (www is a mask for an address ie. www.nytimes.com) corresponds to a computer w/ an IP address (server)
* really get back to server is really 3 docs: HTML(hyper text markup language), CSS, Javascript

#### Rendering in the Browser

* each browser has its own rendering engine to interperet and display the markup
* IE, firefox, sarafi, opera, chrome
* [latest browser stats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers)

#### Two Ways of Responding

1. Hardcoded-static doc
2. Dynamic-html>server>program that generates HTML on the server


### Section 2: Front-End vs. Back-End
comparison: think of a resaturant. Front end what the consumers see. Backend end the kitchen staff, coookware, etc

##### Front-End languages

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript


##### Back-End languages

* ruby (language of the day)
* python
* php
* javascript

##### Back-End frameworks

* ruby on rails (for ruby)
* django (for python)
* node + express (for javascript)

##### New Open Source Javascript Front-End Frameworks

* Amber.js
* Angular.js (this is one instructor uses)
* Meteor.js (very new)
* D3js [creator Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/)
* React.js



### Section 3: What is Programming:

* the preparation of an expected outcome to follow a series of planned, or controlled events
* series of solutions 
> "Everyone should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think." *-Steve Jobs*

**Excercise:** Write step-by-step instructions for how to bake a cake. Think in terms of variables, classifying ingredients, loops, and functions.

##### Why do many programming languages? 

First language is like latin...you can learn other langages...some things are implicit to certain lanagues.  
i.e. German words like zeigtgeist, shadenfraude are not translatable in one word in other langugages.

##### Compiled vs. Interpreted languages 
* ruby is interpreted
* java (not javascript) is compiled i.e. operating at the machine code level (0 and 1s)


####What do programs actually do?
They automate things to make our lives easier.

* mark things up (HTML/CSS)
* keeping track of things (variables)
* making decisions (if>then)
* repeating things (loops)
* displaying things
* logs things (log files)
* storing things (databases)

Coding idiom: Keep it dry (means don't repeat yourself)

#### What can I build?

* websites (static)
* web applications (processes/servers data)
* native apps
* other things

### Section 4: Web Developemnt

##### Who makes the web?

* web designer
* web developer (back end developer)
* front end developer (front end engineer)
* full stack developer (float between front and back end)
* dev ops (liason between IT, database, server processes, very technical job)
* ux designer (user experience...researh how people use the website.)
* ui designer (user interactive...dealing with the interfaces. Testing out aesthetic of website. Design with photoshop/illustrator.)
* interaction designer
* product manager
* SEO specialist

#### Stages of Web Development
* design
* develop
* test

#### Create a User Story
Answer these three questions:

* I as a (role at company)
* I want to (goal)
* in order to (benefit)

#### Project Management Systems:

* Asana (good storage)
* Pivotal Tracker
* Basecamp


#### Question your team need to be asking:

* who are our users? (audience)
* what are their goals? (interface)
* why do they suport us? (purpose)
* what aretheir habits?
* when are they visiting?
* what do we need to do in order to make this happen more often?


#### Design Steps

##### 1. User Experience (UX)

Compare and contrast: [nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/) vs. [buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/)

NYT: text, classic, hierachy of concerns, organized, b&w

Buzzfeed: visual, busy, no hierarchy, colorful

##### 2. Information Architecture (IA)

* blueprints for the site
* flow charts
* pre-wireframes (use thumnails. Focus on idea generation. Can be hand written. Basic shapes don't spend too long)
* wireframes. 
* * To see other sites wireframes: [Instant Wireframe](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/wireframe)
and [Wirify](http://www.wirify.com/)
* * [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/) allows you to build and share wireframes


#### Methodology for Stucturing a Team:

**Waterfall**

* Strict parameters of success, features, deadline.
* one chance to get produce tirght
* less opportunity for feedback
* less communication btwn different groups
* following a plan

**Agile**

* allows you to pivot
* many changes to get the product right
* more opportunity for feedback
* more communication between groups
* responding to change

Daily stand up meetings: what you plan to accomplish today, what you need help with, what is being delayed.


####Should I use an API? 
API stands for Application Programming Interface. Grants one computer access to another computers database.
